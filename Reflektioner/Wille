Vi har börjat med att lära oss git kommandon och GitHub för att samarbeta. Var mycket nytt och lite struligt med olika branches i början men har lärt mig hur git pull, add, commit, push och branches fungerar. Började även skapa filer snabbt direkt i terminalen med antingen cat kommandot eller nano för textediting, som för denna journal till exempel.

Today we delegated the work like so:
Albin: BurgerOrderer frontend
Adde: Kitchenview frontend
Wille: Backend and database research

My goal today is to research how we are going to develop the backend. Since the frontends are being written in HTML/Javascript I think node.js / express.js is the best fit. As for the database, MySQL seems like the most simple choice. 

I started with asking an AI for pointers which led me to researching front-backend communication with Javascript (AJAX/Fetch).

I learned how the server acts as a middleman. AJAX is used to send/receive data (P0ST and GET method) to a node.js/express.js server. Express.js is used to handle the HTTP requests and store data, as well as serve the html files with said data.

I managed to connect two frontends with a node.js server to send and receive simple messages. I used P0ST/GET requests with fetch on a shared route with the server((app.get(‘route’, (req, res)). 

So far, the data is stored and shared with variables, which is not ideal. Therefore we will need to learn how to use mySQL and create a persistent database.

Today we are working together to make sure everyone has a feel about how our structure looks, and how the communication between all of our files work.
Contrary to my previous journal update, we've decided to go with Flask in python instead of previous javascript backend. Luckily the code 
seemed very alike, and we are still using the P0ST and GET methods through a shared route with the server. As I understand it now, the server simply sends the most recent stored data from A to B,
so we have to figure out how to first send the data through a database so we can store and possibly choose what data to send to the kitchen.

We've also decided that the easiest and most efficient way to go forward with the burgerorderer is to simply have buttons for the selection of items, and have an optional comment input if the customer
would like to remove/add something on their burgers. For that we need to figure out how we can store multiple choices in an order before it gets sent to the server.

Researched docker, learned a lot about the importance of isolating environements to make it easier to troubleshoot any errors and making sure the customer gets a working product on any system supported.

Learned about using MySQL as a database and how to connect it to a server to store data. I mostly watched educational videos, and tried using it on a quick test application.

Today we gathered to discuss the plans ahead, and what more needs to be done.
We split up todays work with Albin on debugging, Adde on the database and I started working on our containers and dockerfiles. 

I've learned a lot about how containers and docker works. I created our dockerfiles and began on a docker-compose.yaml file, as well as re-organized a bit of our git repository. Although it's going OK, I find a lot of the stuff confusing and am struggling to find the logical connection with some of this stuff. Im trying not to get hung up on the logic and how it works on the deepest level possible, but to focus on what works and go from there.

I've had some minor problems with making sure the docker files and containers work as they should, but I've started to get a hang of it. I find myself scratching my head over what turns out to be minor problems like indentation errors, soaking time and focus. Still I have realized how useful Docker and working in containers is, and how it's almost essential for applications you send to customers around the world.

Today I'm going to try and dip my feet into the debugging section of the assignment. At first glance it feels kinda out of my league, but I will begin my research and do my best. One thing I've found really difficult these past days are working together as a team when you don't have any coding experience. Sometimes it feels like we are working around each other and I find it hard to apply logic and understanding to code someone else has written, mostly just in this instance where I need to learn how to test and debug it.

Today I'm getting kind of stressed. I got sick and haven't made any progress on my debugging. I will start where I left of and I'll be looking into making an automated script that can test different responses from our kitchen view container. 

I've found out that python has a unittest module for testing python code and will continue to research its usecases.

Getting straight back in to the creation of a test script for kitchen view. Yesterday I found out about pythons unittest module which I hope to be expanding on today. 
I've also figured out that Flask has its own built in test functionality. You can create a test client and configure it for testing, which enables better logs and shows exceptions clearly. The test client is useful because you don't need to start a server to simulate responses. 

On the first run I got two errors that says it was unable to open database file.
I've read up on the errors which seem to be quite common, and since it works for all of us I will assume it is not a critical error with our actual application. I've tried finding some solutions online, but to be honest they all seem super advanced so far. I will sleep on it and try to come up with something tomorrow.

In my automated test for kitchenview I send get requests and make sure it returns properly. The operationalError I get has not yet been resolved and I don't know how to resolve them, which is making me quite angry and frustrated.
