Ingenjörsdagbok - Wille Norman

Börjat få ihop git commandon, var struligt med olika branches i början men har lärt mig hur man rebasear och/eller mergear
branches. Började även skapa filer snabbt direkt i terminalen med antingen cat kommandot eller nano för textediting.

Today we delegated the work like so:
Albin: BurgerOrderer frontend
Adde: Kitchenview frontend
Wille: Backend and database research

My goal today is to research how we are going to develop the backend. Since the frontends are being written in HTML/Javascript I think node.js / express.js is the best fit. As for the database, MySQL seems like the most simple choice. 

I started with asking an AI for pointers which led me to researching front-backend communication with Javascript (AJAX/Fetch).

I learned how the server acts as a middleman. AJAX is used to send/receive data (P0ST and GET method) to a node.js/express.js server. Express.js is used to handle the HTTP requests and store data, as well as serve the html files with said data.

I managed to connect two frontends with a node.js server to send and receive simple messages. I used P0ST/GET requests with fetch on a shared route with the server((app.get(‘route’, (req, res)). 

So far, the data is stored and shared with variables, which is not ideal. Therefore we will need to learn how to use mySQL and create a persistent database.
